## Goal

Now it's time to use everything you have learned to complete some turtle challenges.

1. *Standard Level* - Complete four of the turtle challenges from the challenges document.  Only one of these challenges can be from numbers 1-15.  The other three must be from numbers 16-40. These challenges need to be efficient and use the fewest lines of code possible.  The finished product must include comments to clearly describe what each block of code is doing. Feel free to add color to the final product!

2. *Advanced Level* - Complete four of the turtle challenges from the challenges document.  The challenges must be from numbers 16-40.  The code will include user input and a while loop.  These challenges need to be efficient and use the fewest lines of code possible.  The finished product must include comments to clearly describe what each block of code is doing. Feel free to add color to the final product!
